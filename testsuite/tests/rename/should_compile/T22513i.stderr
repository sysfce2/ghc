T22513i.hs:9:6: warning: [GHC-54201] [-Wterm-variable-capture]
    The type variable ‘id’ is implicitly quantified,
    even though another variable of the same name is in scope:
      ‘id’ imported from ‘Prelude’ at T22513i.hs:3:8-14
           (and originally defined in ‘base-4.18.0.0:GHC.Base.FunOps’)
    This is not forward-compatible with a planned GHC extension, RequiredTypeArguments.
    Suggested fix: Consider renaming the type variable.
